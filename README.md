This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS.

The order book architecture is documented in [docs/orderbook-architecture.md](./docs/orderbook-architecture.md).

* [/iosApp](./iosApp/iosApp) contains an iOS application. Even if you’re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform,
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.

* [/sharedLogic](./sharedLogic/src) is for the code that will be shared between app targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is [commonMain](./sharedLogic/src/commonMain/kotlin). Keep websocket, parsing,
  aggregation, and platform-neutral state here.

* [/androidApp](./androidApp/src/main/kotlin) contains the Android-specific Compose UI. It consumes
  `sharedLogic` directly; UI is intentionally platform-owned.

### Running the apps

Use the run configurations provided by the run widget in your IDE's toolbar. You can also use these commands and options:

- Android app: `./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug`
- iOS app: open the [/iosApp](./iosApp) directory in Xcode and run it from there.

### Running tests

Use the run button in your IDE's editor gutter, or run tests using Gradle tasks:

- Android tests: `./gradlew :sharedLogic:testAndroidHostTest`
- iOS tests: `./gradlew :sharedLogic:iosSimulatorArm64Test`
